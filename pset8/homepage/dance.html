  <p>One of my favorite contemporary ballet works, <em>January, 1987</em>, illustrates the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=toro+nagashi&tbm=isch&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj0lMrXrfDrAhXHT98KHWozCQoQrNwCKAF6BQgBEPUC&biw=1245&bih=646" target="_blank">Toro Nagashi</a>, a Japanese festival where thousands of candlelit lanterns are floated down river ceremoniously to remember the lives and spirits of lost loved ones.</p>
  <p>Over my career, I've taught kids (and adults!) of all ages ranging from elementary school, to pre-professional students. And, they have been all over the place: New England, Texas, Michigan, L.A., Hawai'i... where to next?</p>
  <p>My class focuses on preparing the body with a progressive and kinesthetic floor and barre warm-up, culminating with improvisation.</p>
  <h4>Digital Dance</h4>
  <p>Two of my favorite hobbies are photography and videography!</br>It subsequently has made me an Adobe Creative Cloud nerd: Ps & Lr to edit my random musings, and for digital dance shorts and special effects, I love Pr, Ae, and iMovie.</p>
